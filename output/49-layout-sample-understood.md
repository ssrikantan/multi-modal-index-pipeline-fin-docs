# Growing digital transaction

· Digital payments have significantly
increased in recent years, because of
coordinated efforts of the Government
and RBI with all the stakeholders, UPI
volume for FY25 (until June) recorded
to 2,762. India accounts for nearly 46%
of the world's digital transactions (as
per 2022 data).

. According to the Boston Consulting
Group, PhonePe has 47% of UPI
market share followed by Google Pay
(at 34%) in FY23 (April-December).
Financial transactions via digital
channels accounted for 92% of the
overall transactions. Out of which, the
total share of UPI transactions was 42%
in 9M FY23.

· In November 2022, RBI launched a pilot
project on central bank digital currency
(CBDC). The platform is called NDS-
OM CBDC. The Central Bank stated
that the use case for the wholesale
digital rupee is for the "settlement of
secondary market transactions in
government securities“ as it would
reduce transaction costs.

2. A green hexagon with an icon representing networked individuals.
3. An orange hexagon with an icon of a barn in a rural setting with a sun overhead.

- The green hexagon with the networked individuals icon probably signifies connectivity, collaboration, or community.
- The orange hexagon with the barn and sun icon appears to symbolize agriculture, environment, or rural development.</figure>


# Higher ATM penetration

· The Indian Managed Services and
Outsourcing industry has been playing
a key role in faster expansion of ATM
network to achieve the last mile
financial inclusion.

. As of June 2024, the total number of
micro-ATMs in India reached
15,17,580. Moreover, there are
1,26,772 on-site ATMs and Cash
Recycling Machines (CRMs) and
90,142 off-site ATMs and CRMs.

· With the increased penetration of ATMs
through outsourcing model, customers
also find it more convenient to transact
at ATMs deployed closer to their work
or residential areas rather than going to
distantly located bank branches.


# Rising rural penetration

· In Union budget 2024-25, announcement made to open 100
branches of India Post Payment Bank are set to be established
in the Northeast region to enhance banking services.

· The RBI has launched a pilot to digitalize KCC lending in a bid
for efficiency, higher cost savings, and reduction of TAT. This is
expected to transform the flow of credit in the rural economy.

· 100% of new bank account openings in rural India are being
done digitally.

### 1 Robust demand

BCG predicts that the proportion
of digital payments in India will
grow to 65% by 2026.

Demand seems particularly
strong when it comes to the
critical need of protecting
consumer data, where incumbent
banks have a trust advantage.
Some super apps may also turn
to banks for access to banking
licenses and to meet other
regulatory requirements.

Indian Fintech industry currently
is US$ 111 billion and estimated
to be at US$ 421 billion by 2029.
India has the 3rd largest FinTech
ecosystem globally.


### 2 Business fundamentals

Digital modes of payments have grown by leaps
and bounds over the last few years. As a result,
conventional paper-based instruments such as
cheques and demand drafts now constitute a
negligible share in both volume and value of
payments. As on July 2024, there were 602
banks actively using UPI. The total number of
digital transactions during December amounted
to 15.08 billion, with a total value of Rs. 2.1
trillion (US$ 25.27 billion).


<figure>Description: This is a circular infographic divided into four quadrants, each labeled with a number (1, 2, 3, and 4) and an icon representing respective concepts. At the center of the circle, the text "ADVANTAGE INDIA" is displayed with a target and arrow icon.

Insights:
- Quadrant 1 (Top-left, blue): Features an icon of a person climbing steps with a dollar symbol, labeled with the number "1".
- Quadrant 2 (Bottom-left, gray): Features an icon of a stack of coins with a dollar symbol, labeled with the number "2".
- Quadrant 3 (Bottom-right, orange): Features an icon of a document with a shield, labeled with the number "3".
- Quadrant 4 (Top-right, dark blue): Features an icon of an unlocked padlock, labeled with the number "4".

This visual is likely used to summarize key advantages or pillars related to "Advantage India" in a specific context, but further text or explanation would be needed to provide detailed insights.</figure>


### 4 Innovation in services

In the recent period, technological
innovations have led to marked
improvements in efficiency, productivity,
quality.

In Union Budget 2023, the KYC process will
be streamlined by using a 'risk-based'
strategy rather than a 'one size fits all'
approach.

In September 2023, Hitachi Payment
Services launched India's first-ever UPI-
ATM with NPCI.

Digitalization of Agri-finance was
conceptualized jointly by the Reserve Bank
and the Reserve Bank Innovation Hub
(RBIH).


### 3 Policy support

In Union Budget 2023, a national financial information
registry would be constructed to serve as the central
repository for financial and ancillary data.

In November 2022, RBI launched a pilot project on
central bank digital currency (CBDC).

In March 2023, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB), in
collaboration with Airtel, announced the launch of
WhatsApp Banking Services for IPPB customers in
Delhi.

<figure>Description: 
The visual contains a line graph overlaid on a bar chart. The line graph is represented by a series of white points connected by lines, trending downward, then slightly upward.

Insights:
- The background is dark, and the bars have a gradient of blue, which makes the foreground data points and lines stand out distinctly.
- There are no clear axis labels or units provided in the image, making it challenging to determine the precise context of the data represented.
- A visible value "299.33" is noted near one of the points on the line graph, but without further data or context, a detailed analysis of trends or insights cannot be accurately provided.

### Housing and personal finance have been key drivers ... (1/2)

. According to a report published by the Associated Chambers of
Commerce and Industry of India, In terms of development and
maturity, the Indian financial sector has recently exhibited an
encouraging trend. The amount of outstanding mortgage loans has
increased by a healthy 16% over the past 5 fiscal years.

· Credit under the housing segment from US$ 114 billion in FY16 to
at US$ 320.18 billion in FY24* (till January 2024) *.

· By 2040, it is predicted that the real estate market will reach Rs.
65,000 crore (US$ 7.9 billion). This represents a considerable
increase over the 2019 real estate market value, which was pegged
at Rs. 12,000 crore (US$ 1.4 billion). 13% of India's GDP is
projected to be generated by the housing industry by 2025.

· Players in the housing finance sector include public and private
sector banks and home finance companies. Public Sector Banks
(PSBs) and Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) had around 40%
and 39% of the market share, respectively, in the 2019 fiscal year.

. According to BCG analysis, banks like Bank of Baroda and IndusInd
Bank sourced 85% and 77% personal loans digitally.

· RBI's adoption of the Colending Model has paved the way for a
model in which non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), housing
finance companies (HFCs), and banks can collaborate and enter
into an agreement to perform joint origination and lending in the
market.
